git and github
git is software for testing changes
handles any set of data
used by programmers to work collaboratively
developing source code during software development.
version control and code sharing


whereas github 
is a source code manager
offers distributed version control.
centralized code source hosting

git
centralized version control
commit and update

distributed version control
existance of repository

code cycle
